**Elucidating Language Intelligence & Representation**

ELION Lab is a research group at Konkuk University, led by Prof. Jaehyung Seo. We explore the frontiers of natural language processing and AI systems, aiming to understand how language models represent knowledge, reason, and generate meaning toward interpretable, controllable, and trustworthy language intelligence.

## 🔬 Research Areas

- **Language Models & World Models** - Studying how scale, structure, and representations support reasoning and world modeling
- **Thinking & Reasoning** - Interpreting how language models perform multi-step reasoning
- **Hallucination Detection & Mitigation** - Detecting and reducing ungrounded generations
- **Model Editing** - Modifying internal knowledge representations without retraining
- **Multilingual & Multimodality** - Building unified models across languages and modalities
- **AI Agents** - Designing language-model-based agents for real-world interaction
